# Scripts

Some useful scripts that I always end up copying around on my computer. 
Thanks to this repo, they can be included as a submodule in other repos:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/duembgen/scripts
```

After that, you can automatically setup the git hook for always removing jupyter notebook outputs before committing and running yapf by running 
`./scripts/setup_repository` from the root of your project.
